#  QuickCart – The Polite MERN E-Commerce Cart

Welcome to **QuickCart** – the friendliest little e-commerce cart system on the block!  
Built with the mighty MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), QuickCart is here to help you shop, cart, and checkout with a smile. 😄

## Features

### 🛍️ Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- **POST /products** – Kindly add a product (fields: `name`, `price`, `imageUrl`)
- **GET /products** – Politely list all products
- **POST /cart** – Add a product to a user’s cart (no pushing or shoving, please!)
- **GET /cart** – See all the lovely products in your cart
- **DELETE /cart/:productId** – Remove a product from your cart (no hard feelings)

#### Bonus Etiquette (Optional)
- JWT-based dummy authentication with hardcoded users (because everyone deserves a little privacy)
- Support for cart per user using JWT (your cart, your rules!)

---

### 🖥️ Frontend (React.js)
- View all products (window shopping encouraged)
- Add products to your cart (treat yourself!)
- View your cart with a running total (math, but make it fun)
- Remove products from your cart (Marie Kondo would approve)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Niceties

- MongoDB (Atlas-friendly for cloud connoisseurs)
- Mongoose for schema modeling (because structure is polite)
- React functional components & hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) – modern and snappy!
- Frontend and backend run on separate ports (because boundaries matter)
