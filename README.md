# MERN ECOM PROJECT üöÄ

> **Author: Harsh Tomar**

Welcome to the ultimate beginner-friendly, quirky, and fully-featured MERN E-Commerce project! This repo is your one-stop shop for learning how to build a full-stack app with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Brought to you by **Harsh Tomar** (yes, that's me!).

---

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

### Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

- **Add Products:** `POST /products` (fields: name, price, imageUrl)
- **List Products:** `GET /products`
- **Add to Cart:** `POST /cart`
- **View Cart:** `GET /cart`
- **Remove from Cart:** `DELETE /cart/:productId`
- **Bonus:** JWT-based dummy authentication with hardcoded users, and each user gets their own cart (thanks, JWT!).

### Frontend (React.js)
- **View all products** (shop till you drop!)
- **Add product to cart** (because one is never enough)
- **View cart with total amount** (math done for you)
- **Remove product from cart** (regret-proof shopping)
- **Register, Login, Logout** (because security is cool)

## üõ†Ô∏è How I (Harsh Tomar) Built This

- **MongoDB Atlas** for the database (cloudy with a chance of data!)
- **Mongoose** for schema modeling (no more wild west data)
- **React functional components & hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) for a modern, snappy UI
- **Backend & frontend run on separate ports** (no port fights here)
- **Zen-inspired UI** for a premium, minimalist shopping experience
- **All requirements & bonus features?** You bet, all checked off by Harsh Tomar!
